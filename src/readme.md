Final semester assignment, Kristiania University college, autumn 2024.

E-commerce concept, imitating server with local storage to add and remove from cart, and to store client info on order confirmation.

Final project of the semester.
Exercise in handling all subjects of the semester.
DOM Manipulation, array handling, local storage, HTML CSS and JS

Issues i had to resort to gpt for:
-after first attempts at writing code, checked for spelling errors, noticing mistakes.
-Issues with correct pulling and pushing from localstorage (so that the cart is accurately represented in all windows and changes are immediately visible)
-event listener for click outside cart to close it.
-function to calculate and display cart total (with added help from course supervisor)
-function to remove items from cart referencing correct ID.

Otherwise, much functionality was derived from class workshops and the like, but applied and styled for the purposes of this project.
